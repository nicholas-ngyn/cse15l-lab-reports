# Lab Report 5: 
## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario  

## Part 2 – Reflection
In past couple of weeks of going to lecuture and lab, there were two major experiences that has been very interesting to me.  
The first one was the use of bash scripts to create auto-graders, in which you can write comamnds in the script to change different  
directories and run JUnit tests. I imagine that there could be countless cool functionality that I could make using a script. The  
second thing that caught my attention was the introduction of VIM. I find it awesome that you could edit a file without having to open  
it up in a VSCode window. So whenever you need to fix a simple mistake, VIM can help you access the file quickly and make a quick edit.  
Overall, I think CSE15L is a very interesting class in learning different tools to assist you in coding.
